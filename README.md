# CTCI
Cracking the Coding Interview Problem Implementations

My process is as follows:
1. Read through reading part of the section and take notes on concepts.
2. Try my best to implement each solution, even if I know it can be done in a better way. If I know
   of multiple ways to do the problem I am trying to implement all of them.
3. After finishing the entire chapter, I will go through the solutions. I will star and re-implement the ones that
   I was unable to do in the most efficient way.
